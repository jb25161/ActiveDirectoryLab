<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
Within this lab, I am going to walk through how to create an Active Directory home lab enviornment with the use of Oracle Virtual Box. Running and configuring this lab will develop my understanding of how windows networking and active directory function.  I would highly recommend running this through a few times, let your curiousity run free and ask questions, whilst having the end goal of trying to build it by yourself without watching the video!
